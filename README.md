# orbit-simulator
Simulations of the Newtonian N body problem, written in Rust.

This project was born out of a desire to apply the numerical methods I learned in a computational physics class, as well as to learn the Rust language.
The main computational components are in place, and a crude display is made with gnuplot. The plan is to get this simulaiton running in the browser as
I learn more about web development.
